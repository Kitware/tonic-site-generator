Youâ€™ll find this post in the `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You
can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web
server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext`
and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight javascript %}
function print_hi(name) {
   console.log("Hi, ", name, "!");
}
print_hi('Patrick');
#=> prints 'Hi, Patrick!' to the console.
{% endhighlight %}
