This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to Tonic. We’ll cover topics such
as getting Tonic up and running, creating and managing your data,
customizing the way Tonic works and looks, deploying to various
environments, and give you some advice on participating in the future
development of Tonic itself.

## So what is Tonic, exactly?

Tonic is a simple, fast, visualization tool for analyzing and visualizing your
data. It takes a directory containing raw data files in various formats, runs it through
converters, and spits out complete, web-based analysis and visualization tools.
