For the impatient, here's how to get boilerplate Tonic up and running.

{% highlight bash %}
~ $ git clone https://github.com/patrickoleary/tonic.git
~ $ cd tonic
~/tonic $ npm install
~/tonic $ grunt init
~/tonic $ grunt
~/tonic $ grunt serve
# => Now browse to http://localhost:8081
{% endhighlight %}

If you wish to install Tonic into a different directory, you can do so by alternatively
running <code>cd different directory</code> then follow the same quick start procedure.

That's nothing, though. The real magic happens when you start creating data, using the widgets
and views in your layouts, and taking advantage of all the awesome  options Tonic makes
available.

If you're running into problems, ensure you have all the [requirements
installed][Installation].
