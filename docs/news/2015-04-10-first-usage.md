When thinking of this project we were trying to standardize the look of our
web projects while providing a better way of documenting them. 

In order to achieve that we build that project to ease and automate the generation
of a compelling web site for our project.

This project is still in an early stage but we expect the theme provided to evolve
and become slicker. 

So be patient and stay tune...
